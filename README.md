# ‚¨ÜÔ∏è KoboToolbox Data Uploader

This is a **Streamlit web application** designed to upload or edit data in bulk for a **KoboToolbox survey project**.

It provides a user-friendly interface to connect to your Kobo account, select a project, and either upload new submissions from a template or download existing data for editing and re-uploading.

---

## üß© Key Features

### Two Modes

- **Upload New Submissions**  
  Generates a blank Excel template based on your project's survey form.  
  You can fill this template and upload it to create new records.

- **Edit Existing Submissions**  
  Exports your project's current data. You can edit this file and re-upload it to update existing records.  
  The app matches records using `_uuid` or `meta/instanceID`.

### üîê Secure Connection
Connects to the KoboToolbox API (Global, EU, or custom server) using your private API token.

### üß† Smart Template Generation
Automatically builds an Excel/CSV template that matches your survey's schema, including handling geopoint components.

### ‚úÖ Data Validation
Intelligently finds the correct submission ID (`_uuid`, `meta/instanceID`, etc.) from your uploaded file for edits.

### üìä Submission Reporting
Provides a row-by-row report of which submissions were **successful**, **failed**, and **skipped**.
